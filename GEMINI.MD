hey GEMINI, this is your task: 

I need you to create a multi-pages streamlit app for my AI Avatar course presentation

read /data/notes.md to know what I have learned

all videos in /data folder except sample.mp4 need to be presented, we should put them in one page, and have a dropdown control to select different video
